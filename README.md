## User Stories

## Design

### Colors

As primary and secondary colors, I chose purple and green (here with a more bluish tone) because they are two colors globally connected to feminist movements.

For indicating the correct and incorrect answer of each questions I use green and red because the colors are self-explanatory in this context. I chose a pastel colour in each case because it is easier to integrate into the colour palette of the page.

## Testing

### Manual

### Official Validators

### Bugs

- When a user wants to restart the game the shuffle funcion was not called. I fixed the bug by moving `randomize(questions);` to the `openQuiz()` function.

- When user did not close the modal box it has been displayed (beiing open) on the next slide. I fixed it using following if-statment `if (modal.style.display === "block") {
        modal.style.display = "none";
    }`
